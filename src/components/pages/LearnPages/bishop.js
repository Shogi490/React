            The kakugyo, or bishop, meaning angle mover, can move as many spaces as you want in any diagonal direction, 
            just like a bishop in chess. Unfortunately, it can still only reach half of the spaces on the board. It is still quite mighty, 
            though. It promotes to Dragon Horse.</p>
